## Interface Plate

The custom interface plate is machined from stock aluminum
measuring approximately 12x3x1/8 inches. The drilled hole specifications are shown in the drawing below:

The drilled holes are measured such that the stock size does not 
need to be precise. This plate will later be used to mark the corresponding 
holes on the main box, so the outer eight holes could be measured from 
all four sides. We assume the long edges arrive machined parallel. Note that the 
eight tapped holes around the perimeter of the 
piece should first be drilled with a #29 bit. After aligning
the plate and marking the bottom of the box, the holes are re-drilled
using the specified #18 bit.

</details>

To adhere the interface plate to the main box, first the
cutout must be made with a jig saw. Refer to the drawing below
for placement. Note that the "bottom" of the box is defined when 
the lid is facing upwards and the hinge is on the left side. 
Double check that the internal ground pin is not removed or damaged with the cutout.

<details>
<summary>Tips for machining</summary>
After marking the box according to the above drawing, we marked four points: one
inside each corner of the cutout, offset 3/8" from the edge. We drilled 3/4" holes
at each point, which served as entry points for the jigsaw blade (20 TPI, no 
oscillation). File generously to remove sharp edges.
</details>

After the cutout is finished, use the interface plate to mark
the location of the eight screw holes. When determining the position
of the interface plate, ensure that there is sufficient clearance space
for the locking washer on the nipple pipe.

After making the bottom cutout, all external surfaces of the box are painted white.

Affix the interface plate and conductive rubber gasket to the box with pan head cross
screws, #8-32 5/16", containing a rubber O-ring.

Grind down the back cover of the weatherproof box so that it lays
flat against the interface plate. Drill the center hole with the 
step drill and the clearance holes for the 8-32 screws. Alignment is 
not critical, as long as the center feedthrough connectors are within the center hole,
and the distance between the outer tapped holes matches with their distance
on the interface plate. 

|   Weatherbox Modifications     |
|:------------------------------:|
| ![](/../assets/weatherbox.jpg) |

Note the location of the green ground pin when the
weather box is affixed to the interface plate. Use the provided plugs
to close both side holes. 

Punch out the center hole and corresponding screw holes from the provided
 foam weatherbox gasket. Be sure to thread the extension cord wire through the
 lid and gasket prior to soldering the wires to the feedthroughs. Close both
 weatherbox lid side holes with the provided plugs.

The 1in diameter pipe is secured on both sides by a locking washer (not pictured).
The three SMAs are secured with one nut outside, one locking washer and two nuts
inside. 

Trim the foam gasket flush to the weatherbox, and the conductive gasket 
flush to the interface plate. Using RTV108 translucent adhesive, 
seal the following edges: between the weatherbox lid and body, around all plugs
in the weatherbox, around the outside of the interface plate, and around the outer
locking washer of the 1in nipple pipe.

## Enclosure Plate

The steel plate that comes provided with the enclosure box is discarded and
replaced instead with an aluminum plate. Use a step drill for the four corner
post holes. Drill the chassis holes on the bottom layer of the FEM assembly
so that they fit 4-40x5/16 hardware. For the SNAP and GPS boards which are attached 
with standoffs, the screw length to affix the board to the standoff is 3/16"
and to affix the standoffs to the plate the length is 1/4".

|:-------------------------------------------:|
| ![](/../assets/Enclosure_plate_drawing.png) |

After affixing the FEM, screw the MiniCircuits amplifiers to the SMA connectors 
to determine how high they sit off the plate. Fill the gap with 2-56 size
washers (should be around 3). Drill the 2-56 clearance holes for the amplifiers
with them in place. Choose appropriate screw length, will vary if many more or less 
than 3 washers used.

<!--- If the SNAP is being inserted 'upside-down' in order to incorporate a heat sink
between the SNAP FPGA and aluminum plate, the following drawing should be used
instead:

TODO: Info on the heatsink will go here. Note on the difference in standoff height
with this addition.

TODO: Info on thermally coupling the plate to the box will go here: 0.9 in 
separation, possibly aluminum channel sandwiched with adhesive thermal pads. --->

## Enclosure Lid

<!--- The lid is best drilled in the open position from the inside, so that more
precise measurements can be made from the inner wall of the lid edge. --->

|      Enclosure Lid Drawing      |
|:-------------------------------:|

For the RPi and PSU, the standoffs are 4-40x1/2" hex. Screws through the boards 
are 3/16" and screws through the lid are 1/4". The switch is secured by
5/16" screws and is backed with a nut. The LRS-50 uses metric hardware 6mm in length.

## Fan

The fan can be attached to the lid with 1/4" L brackets and 4-40 hardware. 5/16" screws 
from the fan into the threaded side of the L bracket. 3/4" hardware with locking
washer + nut combo from L bracket through the lid.

In the case where the SNAP FPGA fan is missing, the large fan is mounted directly
to the SNAP board, using the three unused mounting holes on the right hand side. 
The .stl file for the adjustable height 3D printed bracket can be found [here](/../assets/base2.STL). Use #6 hardware to 
attach the fan to the base, and #2 hardware to attach the base to the SNAP. 

The fan is wired to the Fan terminal of the PSU using the braided red and white wire.

## Mounting Brackets

Cut the square tube to 15" plus four 1" spacers. Using the 'X' size drill bit,
drill out the 10th hole and drill a hole between the 6th and 7th holes from the
uncut end. Insert the v-bolt and saddle lock into the drilled holes, fix 
with washer and nut.

Insert bolts through the third hole in from each end. Add 1" spacer to each,
and thread through the tabs on the back of the box. Affix with a washer
and nut.

## Final Steps

Apply lock-tite to all hardware except those with nylocks.

Run fiber cable through the 1 in nipple pipe into the Switch. Plug pipe
with steel wool.

Screw feed to the top of the box using 8/32 hex screws and nuts. The LNAs 
connect to the terminals on the feed, and  SMA cables connect the LNA outputs to 
POLA and POLB on the interface plate. The magnetic GPS unit
attaches to a side arm, and screws into the GPS port on the interface plate.

TODO: side arm?

The GReX box is designed to mount on a vertical pipe. Use the V bolt and
saddle lock to adjust and tighten.
